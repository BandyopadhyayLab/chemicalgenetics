Toolbox to analyze drug response data from Martins et al. 2014

Raw experimental data is in the Plates directory with each file organized by:

GENE_BatchNumber_Replicate

Where BatchNumber is B# where # is an arbitrary number specifying plates that were generated together.
Replicate is A,B,C.. and indicates replicate plates within the same batch

Usage:

In Matlab run the script runAnalysis.m. This will initiate data generation starting from raw data using the annotation file in the annotations folder.
